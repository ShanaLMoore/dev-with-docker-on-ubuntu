# dev-with-docker-on-ubuntu

After fighting with Docker on OSX and the need for 2-way syncs, fsevents, etc.
I developed a desire to get back to a simple(r) development on a linux based
VM. This project is a jumping off point.

# Features

- Docker & docker-compose installed and configured
- Provides a Consul & Registrator setup for DNS communication from host to guest,
  as well as between containers and projects.
- Auto-configuration of a limited clone of the user running `vagrant up`. SSH keys
  are copied to a user created with the same name as the host user.
- NFS mount from guest(ubuntu):~/vagrant_projects to host:~/vagrant_projects to allow
  editing from the host while executing all application code in the guest.
- Extensible by editing localextras.sh to meet needs of cloned user
- Generates script `mount_nfs_share` to remount drive to host if it is disconnected

# Usage

## Terminology

- The guest is the Vagrant Ubuntu box.
- The Host is the OSX box where `vagrant up` is run.
- The user is the user executing the `vagrant up` command.

## Prerequisites

Both vagrant and virtualbox must be available. You may also want to install
docker and docker-compose in order to run docker commands from the host, but
*you do not need the docker-machine to be up*. It may cause problems, and has
not been tested in conjunction with this repo, as this project is an attempt
to replace the docker-machine.

## Basic setup

- Install vagrant either via download or homebrew.
- Copy localextras.sh.example to localextras.sh
- Edit localextras.sh to configure the user's configuration in the guest. You
  may also wish to edit extras.sh
- In this project directory run `vagrant up`. After a few minutes, the user
  will be prompted to enter their password for the host. This will run a few
  commands on the host to setup DNS routing for the .docker domain to the guest.
  See OSX's documenation on /etc/resolver/ files (i.e., `man 5 resolver`).

## Editing
- Connect to the vagrant guest as the user by either
  1. `vagrant ssh` and then `sudo su -l <username>` in the box, *OR*
  2. `ssh localhost -X -p $(vagrant ssh-config | awk '/Port/ { print $2;}')`
- Edit files in ~$USER/vagrant_project

## Using Consul for \*.docker DNS resolution

In order to leverage name resolution for containers from the host, we use consul
and registrator. The initial Vagrant provision script sets up the OSX domain
resolver, but we still need to run a docker container inside the guest to
complete the flow.

- Connect to the guest as described above
- `cd ~/consul-registrator-setup && docker-compose up -d`
- Open a browser and visit http://consul.service.docker:8500 and you should
  see the consul ui

At this point you should also be able to ping the service as well. For other
docker-compose based projects you can make them available by following patterns
similar the one shown in `examples/webapp/docker-compose.yml`

## Notes on using docker-compose

### Use DOCKER_HOST env var to communicate from host to guest daemon

After provisioning the machine, run `export DOCKER_HOST="tcp://192.168.90.10:2375"`
in order to allow local docker tools to communicate to the docker daemon on
the guest.

### In the guest /Users is symlinked to /home

By creating a symlink from /Users to /home in the guest, `docker-compose` files
that use relative paths for volumes (i.e., `.:/home/app/myapp:rw`) will function
as expected when paths are expanded on either the host or guest. Note that this
requires the full path, `/User/<username>/vagrant_projects/path/to/code`, be
available in both guest and host.

# Assumptions

After working with the default docker-machine setup, and exploring a 2-way rsync
triggered by changes on the host, I decided I'd rather work with a standard linux
box setup that we might use in production. The underlying Vagrant setup could be
modified to use CentOS and yum, but I chose to use Ubuntu for now.

The fundamental model is based around these assumptions:
- If you're developing on OSX, you may have a shell config that you'd be
  comfortable using in a linux context.
- Using NFS to share files between host and guest is reasonably fast, and if
  the slowness is in editor actions, that is preferable to awkward setups that
  cause issues with switching git branches, slowdown code compilation, disable
  fs event watching, or result in slow webapp/webpage load times.

# Resizing VBox disks

The VMDK format cannot be resized current (2016-09-05), but it is possible to
clone the drive to the VDI format, and increase the max size of the disk. The
VM must be off in order for this process to execute.

```shell
# clone the drive to a new format
VBoxManage clonehd disk /path/to/current.mdk /path/to/clone.vdi --format vdi
# Resize it to desired size (e.g., 60GB here)
VBoxManage modifyhd /path/to/clone.vdi --resize $(expr 6 \* 10240)
# Replace the original drive
VBoxManage storageattach udev --storagectl SATA --port 0 --device 0 \
  --type hdd --medium /path/to/clone.vdi
```

# Clipboard Support
For Mac, in order to use the clipboard across the host and the guest vagrant box, you must:

1. Download and run [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/)
1. Forward X11 in your ssh connection:

  ```shell
    Host localhost
      ...
      ForwardX11 yes
  ```
  or pass the `-X` flag to the ssh connection string

  ```ssh user@host -X```

## Add Support for `pbcopy` and `pbpaste`
If you prefer to use `pbcopy` and `pbpaste` within the vagrant box just add the following to your shell config.
```shell
# .zshrc or .bashrc
alias pbcopy='xclip -selection clipboard'
alias pbpaste='xclip -selection clipboard -o'
```

## Add Clipboard Support to Tmux

```shell
# .tmux.conf
if-shell "uname -n | grep vagrant" \
  'bind-key -t vi-copy Enter copy-pipe "xclip -in -selection clipboard"'
```
